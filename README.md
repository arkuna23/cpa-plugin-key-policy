# cpa-key-policy

Downstream **API key policy** plugin for [CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI).

In plain words: you issue your own `cpa_…` keys to clients. Each key only sees the models you allow, can be rate-limited and budget-limited, and is routed to real CPA upstream providers (Codex, Claude, OpenAI-compat channels, etc.). CPA’s own `api-keys` can still exist for admin use — **do not put plugin-issued keys into `api-keys`**, or you bypass this plugin.

## What it does (human version)

1. **Issue keys** — create many downstream keys; each has an allow-list of models (or shared aliases).
2. **Route** — client calls with alias name `fast`; plugin rewrites to e.g. `codex` + `gpt-5.4-mini`.
3. **Limit** — per-key RPM, optional daily/weekly USD caps, token or per-call billing.
4. **Isolate credentials (tiers / groups)** — pin a request to Codex free/team/… or to a **custom classify group** so it never lands on the wrong auth file.
5. **Multi-target aliases** — one alias can point at several backends (priority or round-robin).
6. **Web UI** — manage keys, global aliases, and credential classification inside CPA.

## Concepts

### Downstream key

A plugin-owned secret (`cpa_…`). Authenticated only by this plugin. Holds:

- allowed **models** and/or **aliases**
- RPM
- one of two quota modes: cumulative fixed USD quota, or periodic daily / weekly USD limits
- optional `allow_models_endpoint` (see below)

Fixed quota never resets automatically. Administrators can clear only its
cumulative counter in the UI or with `POST …/keys/reset-quota`; daily and
weekly statistics remain intact. Periodic quota preserves the existing UTC
daily and 7-day-window behavior. The model price table can fill individual
rows or overwrite every exact single-target token-price match from the LiteLLM
community reference table.

### Alias (global mapping table)

A reusable name like `fast` that expands to one or more **targets**:

| Field | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `provider` | CPA provider id (`codex`, `claude`, or an openai-compatibility **name** such as `cerebras`) |
| `target_model` | Real upstream model id |
| `group` | Optional credential filter (see [Credential groups](#credential-groups-tiers--classify)) |
| `dispatch` | `priority` (always first usable target) or `round-robin` |
| billing | `tokens` (per-million prices) or `per_call` (fixed USD) |

Keys can **reference** aliases instead of duplicating targets. Multi-target aliases expand to several rules with the same alias name; auth and routing share one pick per request so the `group` filter matches the chosen target.

### Credential groups (tiers + classify)

Two sources of “which auth file may serve this request”:

| Kind | How it appears in the picker | Stored in mapping as |
|------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Built-in tier** (Codex `plan_type`, Antigravity `tier`) | e.g. Free tier / Team | bare name: `free`, `team`, `supported` |
| **Custom classify rule** | e.g. **Custom · vip** | prefixed: `classify:vip` |

**Runtime rule:** if a mapping sets a group, the plugin scheduler **only** picks auth files in that group. No match → hard failure (`auth_not_found`), never silently fall back to another tier.

**Custom classification** (Web UI → Mapping → Credential Classification):

- Match auth-file fields (`filename`, `provider`, `plan_type`, `tier`, …) with a regex.
- Assign a **group name** you choose (stored bare on the rule).
- Catalog and mappings use `classify:<name>` so it never collides with built-in `free` / `team`.
- One file can match **multiple** custom groups (shown under each).
- If no custom rule matches → built-in tier (for Codex/Antigravity) or flat (no group) for other auth-file providers.
- OpenAI-compat / API-key channels stay **flat** (no groups).

Configure classify rules in the UI, or via management API (`/classify-rules`, `/classify-preview`, `/catalog`). You do not need to hand-edit state JSON for normal use.

### OpenAI-compatibility providers

Channels under CPA `openai-compatibility` (e.g. a named proxy) use the **channel name** as `provider`. The plugin maps it to CPA’s internal key `openai-compatible-<name>` when routing. Models must be listed on that channel in CPA config, or the host reports no auth for that model.

## Capabilities (plugin hooks)

| Hook | Role |
|------|------|
| Frontend auth | Know plugin keys; enforce alias allow-list, RPM, budget; stamp route + group metadata |
| Model router | Alias → provider + target model |
| Scheduler | When `group` is set, filter auth candidates by tier / `classify:` group |
| Response interceptor | Non-stream JSON: rewrite top-level `model` back to the alias |
| Usage | Token / per-call billing into the state file |
| Management API + embedded Web UI | Keys, aliases, classify rules, status |

---

## Build

Linux `.so` needs cgo and a matching toolchain:

```bash
make test
make build-linux          # builds web UI, then linux amd64/arm64 .so
make package-linux-arm64  # official ARM64 store ZIP + checksums.txt
# or
make web-build
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -buildvcs=false -tags cshared \
  -buildmode=c-shared -o dist/cpa-key-policy_linux_amd64.so ./cmd/cpa-key-policy
```

On Windows, build the `.so` via WSL/Linux. `go test ./...` uses a non-cgo stub so unit tests run without a shared-library toolchain.

`make package-linux-arm64` produces the official release asset
`dist/cpa-key-policy_0.5.0_linux_arm64.zip` (containing `cpa-key-policy.so` at
the ZIP root), `dist/checksums.txt`, and a standalone `dist/cpa-key-policy.so`.

CLIProxyAPI does not currently expose a local ZIP upload endpoint. Install via
the Plugins Store after publishing the matching GitHub Release and registry
version, or stop CPA and copy `dist/cpa-key-policy.so` to
`<plugins.dir>/linux/arm64/cpa-key-policy.so`, enable the configuration below,
and restart. The Linux `_no-plugin` build cannot load dynamic plugins.

---

## Config

Minimal shape (see also [`config.example.yaml`](./config.example.yaml)):

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled: true
  dir: "plugins"
  configs:
    cpa-key-policy:
      enabled: true
      priority: 10
      state_file: "cpa-key-policy-state.json"
```

Notes:

- If `state_file` exists, it is the source of truth for keys / aliases / classify rules / usage.
- Prefer creating keys and aliases in the **Web UI** or Management API; seed YAML `keys` is mainly for first boot.
- Never commit real key hashes, management secrets, or live host URLs into public docs.

---

## Web Management UI

Embedded in the plugin. After load, open:

```text
http://<your-cpa-host>:<api-port>/v0/resource/plugins/cpa-key-policy/index.html
```

Login with CPA **management** secret (`remote-management.secret-key` / management password). The secret stays in memory only (not `localStorage`); refresh → re-login.

UI areas:

| Tab / page | Use for |
|------------|---------|
| Keys | Create / edit / rotate / delete keys; bind models or aliases; RPM & budgets |
| Mapping → Aliases | Global multi-target aliases, dispatch, pricing |
| Mapping → Classification | Custom credential groups + match preview |
| Model picker | Catalog of providers; tier / **Custom · …** subgroups |

Dev UI without rebuilding the `.so`:

```bash
cd web
npm install
VITE_CPA_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8317 npm run dev
```

## Management API (summary)

Exact paths (no path templates). Auth: CPA management bearer token.

**Keys**

- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE …/keys` (`id` in query or body for mutate)
- `POST …/keys/rotate?id=…`
- `POST …/keys/reset-rpm?id=…`
- `POST …/keys/reset-quota?id=…`
- `GET …/keys/usage?id=…`
- `GET …/status`

**Aliases**

- `GET/POST/DELETE …/aliases`

**Classify**

- `GET/POST/DELETE …/classify-rules`
- `POST …/classify-rules/reorder`
- `POST …/classify-preview` — group → credential ids (UI preview; bare group names)
- `POST …/catalog` — body: auth-file credentials + models; response: picker `entries` with `classify:` groups

Create key (plain key returned **once**):

```bash
curl -X POST "$CPA/v0/management/plugins/cpa-key-policy/keys" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MANAGEMENT_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "team-a",
    "name": "Team A",
    "rpm": 60,
    "models": [
      {"alias":"fast","provider":"codex","target_model":"gpt-5.4-mini","group":"free"}
    ]
  }'
```

Create a multi-target alias:

```bash
curl -X POST "$CPA/v0/management/plugins/cpa-key-policy/aliases" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MANAGEMENT_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "alias": "cheap-chat",
    "dispatch": "priority",
    "billing_mode": "tokens",
    "targets": [
      {"provider":"cerebras","target_model":"gpt-oss-120b"},
      {"provider":"codex","target_model":"gpt-5.4-mini","group":"free"}
    ]
  }'
```

## Client request behavior

| Case | Result |
|------|--------|
| Known key + allowed alias | Auth OK → route → optional group filter → upstream |
| Known key + unknown model | Auth rejected |
| RPM / budget exceeded | Rejected |
| Group set, no matching auth file | `auth_not_found` / unavailable (no cross-tier leak) |
| Unknown key | Plugin declines; CPA may try native `api-keys` |
| Non-stream chat response | Top-level `model` rewritten to alias |
| Stream | Body not rewritten (v1) |

### `/v1/models` on CPA main port

Per-key `allow_models_endpoint`: **binary** — deny (401) or full global list. CPA cannot filter that list per plugin key on the main port.


---

## Setup checklist

1. Build / install the `.so` into CPA `plugins.dir`.
2. Enable `plugins` + `cpa-key-policy` in CPA config; set `state_file`.
3. Open the Web UI with the management secret.
4. (Optional) Define **classify rules** if you need custom credential buckets.
5. Create **aliases** (multi-target / pricing) and/or pick models per key (with tier or Custom group).
6. Create keys, save the one-time `plain_key`, hand out to clients.
7. Client: OpenAI-compatible base URL = CPA; `Authorization: Bearer cpa_…`; `model` = alias name.
8. Ensure openai-compat channels list the models you map; empty model lists → host “no auth” errors.
